faqs:
  - question: "What is multi-touch attribution?"
    answer: "Multi-touch attribution distributes conversion credit across multiple marketing touchpoints rather than giving all credit to a single interaction. This provides a more complete picture of how different channels work together to drive conversions."
  - question: "Which multi-touch attribution model is best for e-commerce?"
    answer: "For e-commerce with shorter sales cycles, time-decay or data-driven models typically work best. Time-decay credits recent interactions more heavily, which aligns with impulse-driven purchase behavior. Data-driven models learn from your specific conversion patterns."
  - question: "How much data do I need for data-driven attribution?"
    answer: "Most data-driven attribution tools require at least 300-600 conversions per month to build reliable models. Below that threshold, position-based or time-decay models are more practical alternatives."

## Why Single-Touch Attribution Falls Short

If you're still using last-click attribution as your primary measurement method, you're making decisions based on incomplete data. The average B2C customer interacts with a brand **7-8 times** before converting, while B2B buyers average **13+ touchpoints** across a sales cycle that can span months.

Single-touch attribution—whether first-click or last-click—ignores the vast majority of those interactions. It's like judging a basketball team solely on who scored the final point while ignoring every pass, screen, and defensive play that made the shot possible.

**Multi-touch attribution (MTA)** solves this by distributing credit across every meaningful interaction in the customer journey. But not all multi-touch models are created equal, and choosing the wrong one can be just as misleading as single-touch.

## The Major Multi-Touch Attribution Models

### Linear Attribution

Linear attribution is the simplest multi-touch model. It divides credit equally across every touchpoint in the conversion path.

**How it works:** If a customer interacted with 5 touchpoints before converting, each touchpoint receives 20% of the credit.

**Example journey:**
- Facebook Ad (20%) → Blog Post via SEO (20%) → Email Newsletter (20%) → Google Search Ad (20%) → Direct Visit & Purchase (20%)

**When linear attribution makes sense:**

- You're transitioning from single-touch and want a quick improvement
- Your customer journey is relatively short (3-5 touchpoints)
- You don't have enough data for data-driven models
- You want a baseline to compare against more sophisticated models

**Limitations:**

- A casual social media impression gets the same weight as a high-intent branded search
- Doesn't account for the different roles that touchpoints play in the funnel
- Can make all channels look equally valuable, which isn't actionable for budget decisions

### Time-Decay Attribution

Time-decay attribution gives more credit to touchpoints that occur closer to the conversion event. The logic is straightforward: interactions that happen right before a purchase are more likely to have influenced the buying decision than interactions from weeks ago.

**How it works:** Using a half-life formula, credit decreases exponentially as you move further from the conversion. A common setup uses a 7-day half-life, meaning a touchpoint 7 days before conversion gets half the credit of the last touchpoint.

**Example journey (7-day half-life):**
- Facebook Ad, 21 days ago (5%) → Blog Post, 14 days ago (12%) → Email, 7 days ago (25%) → Google Ad, 1 day ago (58%)

**When time-decay makes sense:**

- Your sales cycle is **30+ days** and involves many touchpoints
- You're running promotional campaigns with specific conversion windows
- Bottom-of-funnel optimization is a priority
- You want to bias toward channels that drive immediate action

**Limitations:**

- Systematically undervalues top-of-funnel channels that drive initial awareness
- The half-life setting is arbitrary and significantly impacts results—a 3-day vs. 14-day half-life produces very different attribution
- Can lead to over-investment in retargeting at the expense of prospecting

### Position-Based (U-Shaped) Attribution

Position-based attribution assigns heavy weight to the first and last touchpoints, with remaining credit distributed among middle interactions. The standard split is **40/20/40**.

**How it works:** The first touchpoint (customer discovery) gets 40% credit. The last touchpoint (conversion driver) gets 40% credit. All middle touchpoints share the remaining 20% equally.

**Example journey:**
- Facebook Ad — First Touch (40%) → Blog Post (6.7%) → Email (6.7%) → Retargeting Ad (6.7%) → Google Search & Purchase — Last Touch (40%)

**When position-based makes sense:**

- You value both demand generation and demand capture
- Your business invests in both awareness and conversion channels
- You want a model that doesn't completely ignore mid-funnel interactions
- Your marketing strategy emphasizes both new customer acquisition and closing

**Limitations:**

- The 40/20/40 split is arbitrary—there's no empirical basis for these exact weights
- Middle touchpoints that might be critical (like a product demo or case study) get compressed into the 20% bucket
- Doesn't adapt to your specific data

### W-Shaped Attribution

W-shaped attribution adds a third key milestone to the position-based model: the **lead creation event**. This is particularly relevant for B2B companies where the journey from anonymous visitor to known lead to customer involves distinct phases.

**How it works:** Three key touchpoints each receive 30% credit—first touch, lead creation touch, and last touch. The remaining 10% is distributed among all other interactions.

**Example B2B journey:**
- LinkedIn Ad — First Touch (30%) → Whitepaper Download — Lead Creation (30%) → Webinar (3.3%) → Sales Email (3.3%) → Case Study (3.3%) → Demo Request — Last Touch (30%)

**When W-shaped makes sense:**

- B2B companies with clear lead generation funnels
- Businesses that distinguish between anonymous visitors and identified leads
- Companies with sales-assisted conversion processes
- Marketing teams that need to justify both awareness and lead gen investments

**Limitations:**

- Requires clear definition and tracking of the "lead creation" event
- The 30/30/30/10 split is still arbitrary
- Less applicable for direct-to-consumer or e-commerce businesses

### Data-Driven Attribution

Data-driven attribution uses **machine learning algorithms** to analyze your actual conversion data and determine how much credit each touchpoint deserves. Instead of applying predetermined rules, the model learns from patterns in your data.

**How it works:** The algorithm compares converting paths against non-converting paths to identify which touchpoints most significantly increase conversion probability. Touchpoints that appear more frequently in converting paths—and less frequently in non-converting paths—receive more credit.

**Example journey (hypothetical output):**
- Facebook Ad (15%) → Blog Post (8%) → Email (22%) → Retargeting Ad (43%) → Direct Visit (12%)

Note how the credit distribution reflects what the data shows about each touchpoint's actual influence, rather than a predetermined formula.

**When data-driven makes sense:**

- You have **300+ monthly conversions** (minimum; 1,000+ is better)
- You're spending across multiple channels and need precise allocation
- You want attribution that adapts as your marketing mix changes
- You can invest in attribution tooling (GA4 offers a basic version for free)

**Limitations:**

- Requires significant data volume to produce reliable results
- Can be a "black box"—hard to explain why credit is assigned a certain way
- Models can be biased toward easily trackable channels
- Quality depends entirely on data completeness (garbage in, garbage out)

## How to Choose the Right Model

Choosing an attribution model isn't a purely technical decision—it depends on your business type, sales cycle, data maturity, and organizational needs.

### Decision Framework

**Consider your sales cycle length:**
- Under 7 days → Time-decay or data-driven
- 7-30 days → Position-based or data-driven
- 30+ days → W-shaped (B2B) or custom multi-touch

**Consider your data volume:**
- Under 100 monthly conversions → Linear or position-based
- 100-500 monthly conversions → Position-based or time-decay
- 500+ monthly conversions → Data-driven

**Consider your channel mix:**
- 1-2 channels → Single-touch is probably fine
- 3-5 channels → Position-based or time-decay
- 6+ channels → Data-driven with incrementality validation

**Consider your team's analytical maturity:**
- Basic → Linear (easy to explain and implement)
- Intermediate → Position-based or time-decay
- Advanced → Data-driven with custom modeling

### The Real Answer: Use Multiple Models

The most effective approach isn't choosing one model—it's running **2-3 models simultaneously** and comparing what they tell you.

When multiple models agree that a channel is performing well (or poorly), you can act with confidence. When models disagree, that's where the interesting insights live. A channel that looks great under last-click but poor under first-click is probably a strong closer but weak at generating demand.

Here's a practical comparison approach:

1. Set up GA4's data-driven attribution as your primary model
2. Run last-click as a comparison to understand bottom-of-funnel
3. Run first-click as a comparison to understand top-of-funnel
4. Review all three monthly and look for discrepancies

## Implementing Multi-Touch Attribution

### The Technical Foundation

Before any multi-touch model can work, you need:

- **Consistent UTM tracking** across every campaign and channel
- **Cross-device identity resolution** to connect the same user across sessions
- **Complete conversion tracking** including all revenue events
- **A reasonable attribution window** (typically 30-90 days depending on sales cycle)
- **Server-side tracking** to fill gaps left by browser privacy features

### Validating Your Attribution Model

No matter which model you choose, validate it regularly:

1. **Compare against incrementality tests** — Run lift studies on your top channels and compare the results to what your attribution model shows
2. **Check for common sense** — If your model says a channel with $1,000 spend drove $500,000 in revenue, something is probably wrong
3. **Monitor trends, not absolutes** — Attribution models are better at showing directional trends than absolute numbers
4. **Cross-reference with blended metrics** — Your overall blended CAC should roughly align with what your attributed CAC shows

## Key Takeaways

Multi-touch attribution represents a significant upgrade over single-touch models, but it's not a magic bullet. Remember:

- **Linear** is the simplest multi-touch model and a good starting point
- **Time-decay** works well for businesses focused on conversion optimization
- **Position-based** balances credit between discovery and conversion
- **W-shaped** adds a lead creation milestone for B2B companies
- **Data-driven** provides the most accurate credit distribution but requires sufficient data volume
- **Running multiple models** in parallel gives you the most complete picture
- **Validation through incrementality testing** keeps your models honest

The goal isn't perfect attribution—that doesn't exist. The goal is making your attribution **good enough to consistently make better decisions** about where to invest your marketing budget.
