faqs:
  - question: "What is the minimum budget for programmatic advertising?"
    answer: "Most DSPs require a minimum of $10K-25K/month to be effective. Below this level, you lack enough data to optimize campaigns properly. For most mid-market advertisers, programmatic makes sense at $25K+/month in total digital ad spend, with $5K-10K allocated to programmatic."
  - question: "How is programmatic advertising different from Google Display ads?"
    answer: "Google Display Network is one inventory source. Programmatic DSPs access multiple ad exchanges simultaneously, offering broader reach, more sophisticated targeting, and greater control over placements. Think of GDN as one store and programmatic as an entire shopping mall."
  - question: "Is programmatic advertising good for B2B?"
    answer: "Yes, when combined with strong targeting data. B2B programmatic works well for account-based marketing, retargeting, and awareness campaigns. The key is using first-party data and intent signals rather than relying solely on contextual targeting."

## What Is Programmatic Advertising?

**Programmatic advertising** is the automated buying and selling of digital ad placements through real-time auctions. Instead of negotiating directly with publishers, advertisers use technology platforms to bid on ad impressions as they become available, typically in under 100 milliseconds.

The programmatic ecosystem processes **billions of ad impressions daily** across display, video, native, audio, connected TV, and digital out-of-home formats. For marketers spending significant budgets on digital advertising, understanding programmatic is no longer optional.

## The Programmatic Ecosystem

### Key Players

**Demand-Side Platforms (DSPs):**
Where advertisers buy ad inventory. Major DSPs include:
- The Trade Desk (largest independent DSP)
- DV360 (Google's enterprise DSP)
- Amazon DSP (access to Amazon's shopper data)
- MediaMath
- Xandr (Microsoft)

**Supply-Side Platforms (SSPs):**
Where publishers sell their ad inventory. Examples:
- Google Ad Exchange
- OpenX
- PubMatic
- Index Exchange
- Magnite

**Ad Exchanges:**
Marketplaces connecting DSPs and SSPs where real-time auctions occur.

**Data Management Platforms (DMPs) / Customer Data Platforms (CDPs):**
Systems that collect, organize, and activate audience data for targeting.

### How a Programmatic Auction Works

1. A user visits a website or app
2. The publisher's SSP sends an ad request to exchanges
3. The exchange broadcasts the impression opportunity to connected DSPs
4. DSPs evaluate the impression based on advertiser targeting criteria
5. Qualifying DSPs submit bids (all in under 100ms)
6. The highest bidder wins the impression
7. The winning ad is served to the user

This entire process happens in the time it takes a webpage to load.

## Programmatic Buying Types

### Real-Time Bidding (RTB) / Open Auction

The most common form. Any advertiser can bid on available impressions.

**Pros:** Largest inventory pool, competitive pricing, easy to start
**Cons:** Less premium inventory, potential brand safety issues, less transparency

### Private Marketplace (PMP)

Invitation-only auctions with select publishers offering premium inventory.

**Pros:** Higher-quality inventory, better brand safety, preferred access
**Cons:** Higher CPMs, requires publisher relationships, limited scale

### Programmatic Guaranteed

Pre-negotiated deals with guaranteed impressions at fixed CPMs.

**Pros:** Guaranteed delivery, premium placements, full transparency
**Cons:** Highest cost, less flexibility, requires commitment

### Preferred Deals

First-look access to inventory at pre-negotiated rates before it goes to open auction.

**Pros:** Priority access, fixed pricing, good balance of quality and flexibility
**Cons:** No guarantee of delivery, still requires competitive creative

### Which Buying Type to Use

| Goal | Best Buying Type | Typical CPM Range |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Broad awareness | RTB / Open Auction | $2-8 |
| Quality reach | Private Marketplace | $8-20 |
| Premium placement | Programmatic Guaranteed | $15-40 |
| Balanced approach | Preferred Deals | $10-25 |

Most advertisers start with RTB and graduate to PMPs as they scale.

## Targeting Capabilities

### First-Party Data Targeting

Your own customer and prospect data, the most valuable targeting signal:
- CRM lists matched to digital profiles
- Website visitor retargeting
- App user data
- Purchase history
- Email engagement data

### Third-Party Data Targeting

Data purchased from external providers:
- Demographic data (age, income, household composition)
- Interest and behavioral data
- Purchase intent signals
- B2B firmographic data (company size, industry, revenue)
- Location and mobility data

**Important note:** Third-party data quality varies widely. Verify providers' data sourcing methods and accuracy claims. The deprecation of third-party cookies has degraded some data segments.

### Contextual Targeting

Placing ads alongside relevant content rather than targeting specific users:
- Keyword-based (ads appear on pages containing specific terms)
- Category-based (ads appear on pages about specific topics)
- Sentiment-based (ads avoid negative content contexts)

Contextual targeting has seen a resurgence due to privacy changes. It doesn't rely on user tracking and can be highly effective when well-executed.

### Geotargeting

Target users based on location:
- Country, state, city level
- Zip code or postal code
- Radius targeting around specific addresses
- Location-based behaviors (people who visit certain types of locations)

### Account-Based Marketing (ABM)

For B2B advertisers, target specific companies:
- Upload account lists matched to IP ranges
- Target by company size, industry, and technology stack
- Serve personalized creative to priority accounts
- Measure engagement at the account level

## Creative Formats in Programmatic

### Display Ads

Standard banner ads in various sizes:
- 300x250 (medium rectangle) - most available inventory
- 728x90 (leaderboard) - desktop header placements
- 160x600 (wide skyscraper) - sidebar placements
- 320x50 (mobile leaderboard) - mobile-specific
- 300x600 (half page) - high-impact desktop

### Native Ads

Ads that match the look and feel of the surrounding content:
- In-feed native (appears within content feeds)
- Content recommendation widgets
- Sponsored content placements
- Higher engagement than standard display (typically 2-3x CTR)

### Video Ads

Pre-roll, mid-roll, and post-roll video placements:
- In-stream (plays before/during video content)
- Out-stream (auto-plays within article content)
- Connected TV (CTV) placements
- Video typically commands 3-5x the CPM of display but delivers stronger engagement

### Rich Media

Interactive ad formats:
- Expandable ads
- Floating ads
- Interactive galleries
- Gamified ad units
- Higher engagement but higher production costs and CPMs

### Connected TV (CTV)

Ads served on streaming platforms through smart TVs and devices:
- Rapidly growing inventory
- TV-quality placements with digital targeting
- Non-skippable in most cases
- CPMs of $20-50+ but high completion rates and brand impact

## Brand Safety and Ad Fraud

### Brand Safety Risks

Programmatic's automated nature creates risks of ads appearing alongside:
- Violent or graphic content
- Misinformation or fake news
- Adult content
- Hate speech or extremist content
- Content that contradicts your brand values

### Brand Safety Solutions

**Pre-bid filters:**
- Set category exclusions (violence, adult, gambling, etc.)
- Use domain blocklists of known unsafe publishers
- Apply keyword blocking for specific terms
- Use contextual intelligence tools (IAS, DoubleVerify, Oracle/Moat)

**Allowlists:**
- Create curated lists of approved publishers
- Most restrictive but safest approach
- May limit scale significantly

**Third-party verification:**
- Implement IAS, DoubleVerify, or similar tools
- Real-time content classification
- Post-bid reporting on where ads actually appeared
- Cost: typically $0.02-0.10 additional CPM

### Ad Fraud Protection

Programmatic is susceptible to various fraud types:
- **Bot traffic**: Non-human impressions and clicks
- **Domain spoofing**: Low-quality sites pretending to be premium publishers
- **Ad stacking**: Multiple ads layered on top of each other
- **Pixel stuffing**: Ads rendered in 1x1 pixel spaces

**Fraud prevention measures:**
- Use ads.txt and sellers.json verification
- Implement pre-bid fraud detection (IAS, DoubleVerify, HUMAN)
- Monitor for anomalous metrics (suspiciously high CTR, 100% viewability)
- Avoid suspiciously cheap inventory (if CPMs are too good to be true, they're)

Expect to spend 5-15% of your programmatic budget on verification and brand safety tools. This isn't optional; it's essential.

## Measurement and Attribution

### Programmatic-Specific Metrics

**Viewability:**
- Was the ad actually seen? (IAB standard: 50% of pixels in view for 1+ second)
- Target: 70%+ viewability rate
- Pay attention to viewability across different publishers and placements

**Completion rate (video):**
- Percentage of video ads watched to completion
- Target: 75%+ for 15-second ads, 60%+ for 30-second ads

**Brand lift:**
- Measure awareness, consideration, and preference changes
- Requires survey-based studies (available through major DSPs)
- Best used for awareness campaigns where direct response metrics aren't the goal

**Cross-device attribution:**
- Track user engagement across mobile, desktop, tablet, and CTV
- Programmatic DSPs offer cross-device graphs
- Essential for understanding the full customer journey

### Attribution Models for Programmatic

Programmatic often plays an upper-funnel role, making attribution challenging:

**Last-click attribution** undervalues programmatic because display/video ads rarely generate immediate clicks. Use:

- **View-through conversions** with appropriate windows (7-14 days)
- **Multi-touch attribution** that credits assists
- **Incrementality testing** to measure true lift
- **Media mix modeling** for budget allocation decisions

### Incrementality Testing

The gold standard for measuring programmatic impact:

1. **Geographic holdout**: Run programmatic in some regions, not others
2. **Ghost bidding**: Win auctions but don't serve ads to a control group
3. **On/off testing**: Run programmatic for defined periods and measure impact
4. **PSA testing**: Show public service ads to the control group instead of your ads

Most major DSPs support incrementality testing natively.

## Getting Started with Programmatic

### Prerequisites

Before launching programmatic campaigns:

1. **Solid conversion tracking** across your website
2. **First-party data assets** (customer lists, website audiences)
3. **Creative assets** in multiple formats and sizes
4. **Brand safety requirements** defined
5. **Clear KPIs** (awareness metrics, CPA targets, or ROAS goals)
6. **Sufficient budget** ($10K+/month recommended)

### Starting Strategy

**Month 1: Foundation**
- Choose a DSP (or work with a programmatic partner)
- Set up tracking and conversion measurement
- Build audience segments (first-party + contextual)
- Launch initial campaigns with conservative targeting
- Implement brand safety and fraud prevention tools

**Month 2: Optimization**
- Review placement reports and exclude low-quality sites
- Optimize audience segments based on performance data
- Test different creative formats and messages
- Adjust bidding strategies based on results

**Month 3: Scaling**
- Expand to new audience segments
- Test private marketplace deals for premium inventory
- Implement advanced attribution measurement
- Scale winning strategies

### Self-Serve vs Managed Service

**Self-serve DSPs:**
- You manage campaigns directly
- Lower fees (typically platform fee + media cost)
- Requires programmatic expertise on your team
- Best for: Teams with dedicated programmatic specialists

**Managed service:**
- Agency or trading desk manages on your behalf
- Higher fees (management fee + platform fee + media cost)
- Access to expertise and proprietary data
- Best for: Teams without programmatic experience

**Hybrid approach:**
- Use managed service for initial setup and strategy
- Transition to self-serve as your team builds expertise
- Keep managed service for complex campaigns (CTV, PMP deals)

## The Future of Programmatic

Several trends are reshaping programmatic advertising:

**Privacy-first targeting**: Contextual targeting, first-party data, and privacy-preserving technologies are replacing third-party cookies as the foundation of programmatic targeting.

**Connected TV growth**: CTV inventory is growing rapidly and bringing TV-quality advertising to programmatic with digital-level targeting and measurement.

**AI-powered optimization**: Machine learning is improving bid optimization, creative personalization, and audience prediction across all DSPs.

**Supply path optimization**: Advertisers are becoming more selective about which supply paths they use to reach publishers, reducing waste and improving transparency.

**Retail media networks**: Amazon, Walmart, and other retailers are opening their first-party data for programmatic targeting, creating powerful new targeting capabilities.

For marketers spending $10K+/month on digital advertising, programmatic isn't a niche channel. It's a fundamental part of a mature media strategy that enables reach, precision, and scale that walled-garden platforms alone can't provide.
