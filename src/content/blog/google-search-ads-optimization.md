faqs:
  - question: "What is a good Quality Score in Google Ads?"
    answer: "A Quality Score of 7-10 is good, meaning your ads are relevant and well-optimized. Scores of 5-6 are average and indicate room for improvement. Below 5 means you are overpaying for clicks and need to address relevance issues between keywords, ads, and landing pages."
  - question: "Should I use Smart Bidding or manual bidding in Google Ads?"
    answer: "Smart Bidding (Target CPA, Target ROAS, Maximize Conversions) works best when you have 30+ conversions per month per campaign and accurate conversion tracking. Manual or enhanced CPC bidding is better for new campaigns, low-volume accounts, or when you need tight budget control."
  - question: "How many keywords should I have per ad group?"
    answer: "Keep ad groups tight with 5-15 closely related keywords. Single Keyword Ad Groups (SKAGs) are no longer necessary with modern match types, but themed ad groups with tight keyword clusters still outperform large, loosely grouped keyword sets."

## The Evolution of Google Search Ads

Google Search Ads have changed dramatically in recent years. Expanded Text Ads are gone, replaced by Responsive Search Ads. Smart Bidding has become the default. Match types have been consolidated. And the auction has never been more competitive.

For advertisers spending $10K+/month on Search, these changes create both challenges and opportunities. The fundamentals of relevance and intent still drive performance, but the tactics have evolved significantly.

This guide covers the advanced strategies that separate high-performing Search campaigns from mediocre ones.

## Account Structure That Drives Performance

### The Modern Campaign Structure

The old approach of hyper-segmenting everything into thousands of ad groups with Single Keyword Ad Groups (SKAGs) is outdated. Google's AI performs better with consolidated data.

**Recommended structure for most accounts:**

**Campaign level:** Organize by business goal or product category
- Campaign 1: Core Services (highest priority)
- Campaign 2: Secondary Services
- Campaign 3: Brand Terms
- Campaign 4: Competitor Terms

**Ad group level:** Organize by keyword theme
- Each ad group contains 5-15 tightly related keywords
- Keywords within an ad group should share the same intent
- Ad copy should be highly relevant to all keywords in the group

**Example for a marketing services company:**

Campaign: Marketing Services
- Ad Group: Marketing Attribution → "marketing attribution software," "attribution tracking tools," "marketing attribution platform"
- Ad Group: Marketing Analytics → "marketing analytics tools," "marketing data analytics," "marketing analytics platform"
- Ad Group: ROI Tracking → "marketing ROI tracking," "ad spend ROI calculator," "campaign ROI measurement"

### Campaign Priority and Budget Allocation

Not all campaigns deserve equal budget. Allocate based on intent and value:

| Campaign Type | Budget Share | Priority | Bid Strategy |
|--------------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Brand terms | 10-15% | Highest | Target Impression Share (90%+) |
| High-intent non-brand | 40-50% | High | Target CPA or Target ROAS |
| Medium-intent non-brand | 20-30% | Medium | Maximize Conversions (with cap) |
| Competitor terms | 10-15% | Lower | Manual CPC or Target CPA |

### Negative Keyword Management

Negative keywords are as important as your targeting keywords. Build and maintain:

**Account-level negatives:**
- Completely irrelevant terms (jobs, free, DIY, templates)
- Terms that indicate wrong intent (tutorial, course, certification)

**Campaign-level negatives:**
- Cross-campaign conflicts (prevent campaign overlap)
- Brand terms in non-brand campaigns (if running separate brand campaigns)

**Ad group-level negatives:**
- Prevent overlap between similar ad groups
- Ensure the most relevant ad group serves for each query

**Negative keyword review cadence:**
- Weekly: Review search term reports and add negatives
- Monthly: Audit negative keyword lists for conflicts
- Quarterly: Comprehensive negative keyword cleanup

## Bidding Strategy Optimization

### Choosing the Right Bid Strategy

**Target CPA (tCPA)**
Best for: Lead generation campaigns with consistent conversion values
- Set your target CPA 10-15% above your actual target to give the algorithm room
- Requires: 30+ conversions per month in the campaign
- Advantage: Predictable cost per conversion
- Disadvantage: May limit volume if target is too aggressive

**Target ROAS (tROAS)**
Best for: E-commerce or campaigns with variable conversion values
- Start with a target 20% below your actual ROAS goal
- Requires: 50+ conversions per month with accurate value tracking
- Advantage: Optimizes for revenue, not just conversions
- Disadvantage: Needs accurate value data to work properly

**Maximize Conversions**
Best for: Campaigns where you want maximum volume within a fixed budget
- No CPA target; Google spends your full budget
- Good for: Building data for eventual tCPA transition
- Risk: May deliver low-quality conversions if tracking isn't tight

**Maximize Conversion Value**
Best for: Maximizing total revenue from a fixed budget
- Similar to Maximize Conversions but weighted by value
- Good for: E-commerce with strong value tracking

**Manual CPC / Enhanced CPC**
Best for: New campaigns, low-volume accounts, competitor campaigns
- Full control over individual keyword bids
- Time-intensive but provides maximum control
- Good starting point before transitioning to Smart Bidding

### Smart Bidding Optimization Tips

**Feeding the algorithm better data:**
1. Import offline conversion data from your CRM
2. Use enhanced conversions to improve signal quality
3. Set conversion values based on actual revenue, not arbitrary numbers
4. Exclude micro-conversions (page views, scroll depth) from primary conversion actions

**Adjusting bid strategies:**
- Never change target CPA/ROAS by more than 15-20% at once
- Allow 2-3 weeks after changes for the algorithm to recalibrate
- Monitor the "bid strategy report" for learning phase status
- Set portfolio bid strategies across similar campaigns for more data

**Seasonal adjustments:**
- Use seasonality adjustments for known spikes (Black Friday, year-end)
- Tell Google's algorithm about expected conversion rate changes
- Adjust 1-2 days before the expected change and revert after

## Responsive Search Ad Optimization

### How RSAs Work

Responsive Search Ads allow up to 15 headlines and 4 descriptions. Google's AI tests different combinations and shows the best-performing ones to each user.

### Writing High-Performing RSAs

**Headline strategy (15 headlines):**

Headlines 1-3 (pinned or primary):
- Include your primary keyword
- State your main value proposition
- Include a number or specific claim

Headlines 4-6:
- Different benefit angles
- Social proof elements
- Urgency or scarcity

Headlines 7-10:
- Feature-focused headlines
- Price/offer headlines
- Question-based headlines

Headlines 11-15:
- CTA-focused headlines
- Brand name variations
- Differentiator headlines

**Description strategy (4 descriptions):**
- Description 1: Expand on value proposition with specifics
- Description 2: Social proof or results-focused
- Description 3: Feature list with benefits
- Description 4: CTA with risk reducer (free trial, guarantee, etc.)

### Pinning Strategy

Pinning forces specific headlines into specific positions. Use strategically:

- **Pin to position 1**: Your most important headline (keyword + value prop)
- **Pin to position 2**: Your second most important message (2-3 options)
- **Don't pin position 3**: Let Google test freely
- **Pin one description**: Your strongest value statement

Over-pinning reduces Google's ability to optimize. Pin only when you need to ensure specific information always appears.

### RSA Performance Monitoring

Check asset-level performance monthly:
- **Best**: Keep these headlines/descriptions
- **Good**: Maintain, may improve over time
- **Low**: Replace after 30 days
- **Learning**: Give 2-4 weeks of data before judging

Replace 2-3 assets at a time, never all at once. This maintains the ad's performance history while testing improvements.

## Quality Score Optimization

### Understanding Quality Score Components

Quality Score (1-10) is calculated from three factors:

1. **Expected CTR** - How likely users are to click your ad
2. **Ad relevance** - How closely your ad matches the keyword intent
3. **Landing page experience** - How relevant and useful your landing page is

Each component is rated: Above Average, Average, or Below Average.

### Improving Expected CTR

- Write compelling headlines that include the keyword
- Use numbers and specific claims ("Save 30%," "500+ clients")
- Test different value propositions to find what resonates
- Use ad extensions to increase ad real estate and click appeal
- Improve ad position (higher positions get higher CTRs)

### Improving Ad Relevance

- Ensure keywords and ad copy share the same language and intent
- Organize ad groups around tight keyword themes
- Use dynamic keyword insertion where appropriate
- Write ad copy that directly addresses the search intent

### Improving Landing Page Experience

- Match landing page content to the ad promise and keywords
- Ensure fast load times (under 3 seconds)
- Make the page mobile-friendly
- Provide clear, useful content
- Include obvious navigation and CTAs

### The ROI of Quality Score

Quality Score directly affects your cost per click through the Ad Rank formula:

| Quality Score | Relative CPC | Impact |
|--------------|-------------|--------|
| 10 | 50% discount | Paying half what a QS 7 pays |
| 8-9 | 20-35% discount | Significant savings |
| 7 | Baseline | Average cost |
| 5-6 | 25-50% premium | Overpaying moderately |
| 3-4 | 100-200% premium | Drastically overpaying |
| 1-2 | 400%+ premium | Almost never worth running |

Improving Quality Score from 5 to 8 can reduce your effective CPC by 40-50%. This is one of the highest-ROI optimization activities in Google Ads.

## Search Term Analysis and Keyword Expansion

### Weekly Search Term Review Process

1. Pull search term reports for the last 7 days
2. Sort by spend (highest to lowest)
3. Mark terms as: Convert (add as keyword), Block (add as negative), or Monitor (check again next week)
4. Add high-performing terms as exact match keywords
5. Add irrelevant terms as negative keywords
6. Flag terms that indicate new keyword opportunities

### Keyword Match Type Strategy

With Google's updated match types:

**Exact match [keyword]:**
- Use for your highest-value, highest-intent terms
- Provides most control over query matching
- Allocate 50-60% of non-brand keyword budget here

**Phrase match "keyword":**
- Good for capturing variations of your core terms
- Broader than exact but still maintains intent
- Allocate 25-35% of keyword budget here

**Broad match keyword:**
- Works best with Smart Bidding (tCPA or tROAS)
- Casts the widest net for new query discovery
- Requires aggressive negative keyword management
- Allocate 10-20% of keyword budget here (with Smart Bidding only)

### Finding New Keyword Opportunities

**Sources for new keywords:**
- Search term reports (queries triggering your existing keywords)
- Google Keyword Planner (related terms and volumes)
- Competitor analysis tools (keywords competitors bid on)
- Google Search Console (organic queries you already rank for)
- Customer conversations (language your customers actually use)

## Ad Extensions That Drive Performance

### Essential Extensions

**Sitelinks:**
- Add 8-10 sitelinks per campaign (Google shows 2-6)
- Link to your highest-converting pages
- Include descriptions for each sitelink
- Update quarterly based on performance

**Callout extensions:**
- Highlight unique selling points and differentiators
- Use 6-10 callouts per campaign
- Examples: "No Long-Term Contract," "24/7 Support," "Free Setup"

**Structured snippets:**
- List specific features, services, or product types
- Choose the most relevant header category
- Include 4-6 values per snippet

**Call extensions:**
- Essential for businesses that convert via phone
- Set call reporting to track calls as conversions
- Schedule to show only during business hours

### Advanced Extensions

**Lead form extensions:**
- Allow users to submit information directly from the SERP
- Lower friction than landing page forms
- Monitor lead quality closely (often lower than landing page leads)

**Price extensions:**
- Show prices directly in the ad
- Pre-qualifies clicks (reducing wasted spend on price-sensitive users)
- Update pricing frequently to stay accurate

**Image extensions:**
- Add visual elements to text ads
- Use product images or brand visuals
- Can increase CTR by 10-15%

## Advanced Optimization Tactics

### Auction Insights Analysis

Review auction insights monthly to understand your competitive landscape:
- **Impression share**: Are you losing impressions to budget or rank?
- **Overlap rate**: Which competitors show alongside you?
- **Position above rate**: Who consistently outranks you?
- **Top of page rate**: How often do you appear in top positions?

Use these insights to inform bid adjustments and budget allocation.

### Device Bid Adjustments

Even with Smart Bidding, understanding device performance is critical:
- Review conversion rates by device
- Check CPA by device (mobile vs desktop vs tablet)
- For B2B, desktop often converts better and may deserve higher bids
- For local services, mobile often converts better via phone calls

### Geographic and Schedule Optimization

**Geographic adjustments:**
- Analyze performance by location (state, city, metro)
- Increase bids in high-performing locations
- Decrease or exclude low-performing areas
- For local businesses, set tight geographic targeting

**Ad schedule adjustments:**
- Review conversion data by hour and day
- Reduce bids during low-conversion periods
- Increase bids during peak conversion hours
- Consider pausing overnight for non-24/7 businesses
