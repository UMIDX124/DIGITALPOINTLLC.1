  { question: 'What is the average customer acquisition cost across all industries?', answer: 'The overall average CAC across industries is $198 for B2C and $702 for B2B. However, these numbers vary dramatically by industry — SaaS B2B averages $942 while e-commerce B2C averages $70.' },
  { question: 'How do you calculate CAC?', answer: 'CAC = Total Sales & Marketing Spend / Number of New Customers Acquired. Include all costs: ad spend, sales salaries, tools, content production, and overhead allocated to acquisition.' },
  { question: 'What is a good CAC to LTV ratio?', answer: 'A healthy CAC:LTV ratio is 1:3 or better, meaning your customer lifetime value is at least 3x your acquisition cost. Below 1:3, growth becomes unsustainable. Above 1:5, you may be underinvesting in growth.' },
  { question: 'Which marketing channel has the lowest CAC?', answer: 'Organic search (SEO) consistently delivers the lowest CAC at an average of $87 per customer, followed by email marketing at $102. Paid social averages $186 and paid search averages $162.' },
  { question: 'How has CAC changed in 2026 compared to previous years?', answer: 'Average CAC has increased 14% year-over-year since 2024, driven by rising ad costs and privacy-related signal loss. Companies investing in first-party data and organic channels have seen smaller increases (6-8%).' },
