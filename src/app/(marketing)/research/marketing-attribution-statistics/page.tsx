  { question: 'What percentage of marketers use multi-touch attribution?', answer: 'As of 2026, 34% of marketers use multi-touch attribution (MTA) as their primary model. However, 52% combine MTA with marketing mix modeling (MMM) or incrementality testing for a hybrid approach.' },
  { question: 'How much data is lost due to iOS privacy changes?', answer: 'Post-iOS 17, advertisers lose visibility on approximately 38% of iOS conversions. Combined with browser privacy changes, the average marketer can only directly track 61% of their total conversions.' },
  { question: 'What is the most common attribution model in 2026?', answer: 'Last-click attribution remains the most common model at 41% adoption, despite being widely acknowledged as inaccurate. Data-driven attribution (Google) and algorithmic models are growing, now used by 28% of advertisers.' },
  { question: 'How accurate is marketing attribution in 2026?', answer: 'Studies show that attribution models are 55-70% accurate on average. Platform-reported conversions are typically overstated by 20-40% due to cross-platform overlap. Server-side tracking and conversion APIs improve accuracy by 15-25%.' },
