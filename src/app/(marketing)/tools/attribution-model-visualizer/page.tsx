  { question: 'What is an attribution model?', answer: 'An attribution model is a set of rules that determines how credit for conversions is assigned to different marketing touchpoints in a customer journey. Common models include first-click, last-click, linear, time-decay, and position-based.' },
  { question: 'Which attribution model is best?', answer: 'There is no single best model. First-click favors awareness channels, last-click favors conversion channels. Multi-touch models (linear, time-decay, position-based) give a more balanced view. Most companies benefit from comparing multiple models.' },
  { question: 'What is multi-touch attribution?', answer: 'Multi-touch attribution distributes conversion credit across all touchpoints in the customer journey, rather than giving 100% credit to a single touchpoint. This provides a more accurate picture of marketing effectiveness.' },
  { question: 'How does time-decay attribution work?', answer: 'Time-decay attribution gives more credit to touchpoints closer to the conversion. The last touchpoint before conversion gets the most credit, with each earlier touchpoint receiving progressively less.' },
