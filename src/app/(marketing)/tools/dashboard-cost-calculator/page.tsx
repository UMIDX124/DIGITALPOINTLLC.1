  { question: 'How much does a custom marketing dashboard cost?', answer: 'A custom marketing dashboard typically costs $15,000-$80,000 to build, plus $2,000-$8,000/month in maintenance. Costs depend on data sources, complexity, and whether you use in-house or agency talent.' },
  { question: 'What is the cheapest marketing dashboard solution?', answer: 'Google Looker Studio (formerly Data Studio) is free for basic dashboards. However, costs increase when you need data warehousing ($300-$2,000/month), ETL tools ($200-$1,000/month), and analyst time to maintain them.' },
  { question: 'Should I build or buy a marketing dashboard?', answer: 'Buy if you need standard metrics and have under 5 data sources. Build custom if you need attribution modeling, custom KPIs, cross-platform blending, or automated alerting. Most companies spending $50k+/month on ads benefit from custom builds.' },
  { question: 'What tools do marketing dashboards use?', answer: 'Common tools include visualization (Looker, Tableau, Power BI, Metabase), data warehousing (BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift), ETL (Fivetran, Airbyte, Stitch), and transformation (dbt). The total stack cost ranges from $500-$10,000/month.' },
