    benefits: [
      "Acquisition costs that drop fast — we've cut CPAs by 30-50% in the first 60 days for most accounts",
      "Quality scores that actually go up — we've taken accounts from 4/10 to 8/10 in weeks, which directly slashes your cost per click",

      "Here's the thing about Meta ads: the algorithm is powerful, but it won't save a bad strategy. We build full-funnel campaigns — from cold audiences to retargeting — that give the algorithm what it needs to find your best customers. Creative testing, audience layering, and constant iteration are how we keep results compounding.",
    shortDescription: "Full-funnel Meta ads that actually scale without tanking your margins.",

Most teams we talk to are over-crediting last-click and under-investing in the channels doing the real work. We build attribution models that show you what's truly happening — not just what Google or Meta want you to believe.",
